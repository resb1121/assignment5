     <p> For this project I had to make type and a picture interact with each other. Basketball is very important to me and I have played it my whole life so I thought having text and pictures realate to basketball it would be perfect for this project.

<p>  For this project we had to make a self portrait of ourselves so I wanted to do a basketball theme again because I can easily relate to that. I did a transition from my high school to college and having myself fade into Naz because this is where I am now.

<p>  For this project I had to come up with a logo and packaging design for this company named Free Leaf Artisan Tea. I wanted to make the tea cup out of leaves and make it look healthy because I was trying to get attention of a more high end tea.
