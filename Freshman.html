<p style="margin-left: 20px"> This project is based off the book The Birds By Alred Hitchock. We had to make three different book covers and I wanted to incorporate the bird in all three covers because that is the main subject. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px"> For this project we had to come up with two logos that had to incorporate a object or a blend of two different letters. I decided to do both ways and came up with both logos on my own.

<p style="margin-left: 20px"> For the last project we had to come up with two different album covers. I chose Sam Hunt and Florida Georgia Line because they are my favorite country signers. I think both of the album covers really fit the style of the artist and I like how they came out on the disc.
